# TodoApp Client

## Getting started

Getting started is as easy as running npm install and creating an account!

# Things to consider

- This application allows for creating, updating, deleting and getting Todo entities.
- The getFeaturedTodos query gets Todos from other users.
- Secrets are exposed for the purpose of this project, but we'd want to hide them in a real application.
- We should be handling error and loading states better, but it wasn't necessary in this case.
